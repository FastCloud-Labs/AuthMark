## Problems

Detecting Synthetic Content is hard, deepfakes and voice cloning are becoming indistinguishable from real, this are
powering a new wave of sophisticated scams and crimes.
Misinformation and fake news are becoming a global problem, and the current solutions are not enough to stop it.

Adding digital watermarks, trojan horses and "poisoning" the data used to train the AI models can help to detect
synthetic content.

### 2) Detection

Detection of fake content using AI models that can detect the subtle differences between real and synthetic content.

### 3) Authenticity and Ownership and Verification & deAP (Decentralized Authenticity Protocol)
