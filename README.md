#### AI-Powered Decentralized Content Authenticator
A platform that uses AI to detect and validate the authenticity of digital content, leveraging blockchain for immutable record-keeping of content provenance and creator reputation, thus combating fake news and copyright infringement.

### Fake content detection and validation

The cost of generating fake text, images, video, and voice is dropping, making this problem more acute than rogue AGI. Cryptographic content authentication and decentralized creator reputation can help solve this problem globally.


## Problems

Detecting Synthetic Content is hard, deepfakes and voice cloning are becoming indistinguishable from real, this are powering a new wave of sophisticated scams and crimes.
Misinformation and fake news are becoming a global problem, and the current solutions are not enough to stop it.

## Solutions

### 1) Prevention
Adding digital watermarks, trojan horses and "poisoning" the data used to train the AI models can help to detect synthetic content.
### 2) Detection 
Detection of fake content using AI models that can detect the subtle differences between real and synthetic content.

### 3) Authenticity and Ownership and Verification & deAP (Decentralized Authenticity Protocol)
